# Dart-Flutter-Assignment-3

In this repository you can find how to code in dart using classes and inheritance of class.

# "Person"

Create a Person class with firstName and lastName properties, and a method called fullName() that returns the full name of the person. 
Then create a Student class that inherits from Person and has a major property. 
Override the fullName() method in the Student class to include the major in the full name.


# "Vehicle"

Create a Vehicle class with brand, model, and year properties, and a method called drive() that prints a message indicating that the vehicle is being driven. 
Then create a Car class that inherits from Vehicle and has a numDoors property. 
Override the drive() method in the Car class to print a message that includes the number of doors.

# "BankAccount"

Create a BankAccount class with balance and accountNumber properties, and methods called deposit() and withdraw() that modify the balance property. 
Then create a CheckingAccount class that inherits from BankAccount and has a transactionLimit property. 
Override the withdraw() method in the CheckingAccount class to check if the withdrawal amount is within the transaction limit before modifying the balance property.
